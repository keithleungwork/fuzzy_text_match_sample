# fuzzy_text_match_sample

Welcome to our Fuzzy Search Demo Repository!

Here you will find a collection of code samples and Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various approaches to fuzzy search. Our examples cover popular algorithms such as OpenSearch and Levenshtein distance.

Fuzzy search is a powerful tool used to find approximate matches to a query term. This is especially useful when dealing with large or complex datasets where exact matches may not always be possible. Our goal with this repository is to provide practical examples and guidance for implementing fuzzy search in your own projects.

We hope you find our examples useful and informative. Please feel free to explore the repository and share any feedback or questions you may have. Happy searching!
